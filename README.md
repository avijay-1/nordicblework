"This is the BLE Dual Servo Control, currently operates with GIPO 0.28 turning on when prompted by the activation of LED3, and LED4 can turn on and off by itself. This combines the previous single servo code, and dual LED BLE code. 

Future edits need to have LED4 operating a servo, as well as investigation why 0.28 turns on when that corresponds to LED1, and not LED3's 0.30
